_italics_

**bold**

__bold__

***bold italics*** *__this too__*

___bold italics___ _**and this**_

~~strikethrough~~

    hello, four spaces before me

--- 
the three `---` inserts a horizontal rule

# header1
## header2
###### to header 6

Hello <sup>World</sup>

Hello <sub>World</sub>

`inlineCode()` || `Or emphasized words` 

>quote
>>nested quote

Use `\` as an escape character, to escape the escaper, type `\\`

\*escape character for writing the symbols\* 
\*\*out\*\*

[word here](link here)    
[spoiler](#s "hide words here!")  
[Google](https://google.com)   
[Google](https://www.google.com)  
[Google](www.google.com) *(this won't work)*

  * \* begin URL with an URL scheme like the ones listed:
  * list of URL schemes:
    * http://
    * ftp://
    * mailto: 
    * steam://
    * irc://
    * news://
    * mumble://
    * ssh://

**Line Breaks & Paragraphs** 

* You need four spaces at end of sentence for a line break. Hit return twice `â†µ` for a new paragraph.  

>**_Line Break_**

>With no spaces:

>>No line break 
No line break

>With the four spaces at end:

>>Line break    
Line break

>**_Paragraph Break_**

>*With only one return:*

>>No paragraph break
No paragraph break

>*With two returns*:

>>Paragraph break

>>Paragraph break

**Lists**

>**_Unordered Lists_**

>* Item 1
>+ Item 2
>- Item 3

* for a sublist, put two spaces behind the `*` 
* List 1
  * sublist 1
    * sublist 2 
      * sublist 3
      * new item for sublist 3
    * back to sublist 2
  * back to sublist 1
* back list 1

**_Ordered Lists_**
* for nested lists in an ordered list, put four spaces before the number
1. This is list item 1
2. nested list under here
    1. nested!
        1. nested in a nest
        1. nested in a nest
        3. nested in a nest
    2. nested!
4. It doesn't matter which number you put, it will be sequential
3. What matters is the continuity of the list
* does this break the list?
2. Yes it does
2. also a good point in time to point out that the number used in an ordered list will be the starting number even if in a new list
2. So this is useful incase you accidentally break your ordered list somehow
    * test
    * test
      * test
      1. test
      3. test
      2. test
    * test
2. test
2. also important to know that if you wish to nest an unordered list, it is important to put four spaces behind the `*` so you don't break the ordered list.
2. to break from an ordered list for nesting, you need four spaces. For unordered lists, you just need two.


**Tables**

*not everything supports tables*

one | two | three
- | - | -
a1 | b1 | c1
a2 | b2 | c2

*justify table*
just1 | just2 | just3
:- | :-: | -: 
l | c | r
left | centered | right
